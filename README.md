# Two-Layer Tic Tac Toe #

The game starts at **ttt_gameboard.html**

All the gaming rules are in **ttt_instructions.html**, which can be accessed in **ttt_gameboard.html**

The game can accommodate different `SIZE`s of game-board, as well as different `WINNING_REQUIREMENT`s, but one must change them manually in **ttt_functionality.js** (for both of them) and **ttt_appearance.css** (for only the `SIZE`, and I recommend a literal/value less than 32); these two variables are in the first few lines for both files, so they can be found easily.

This is **Player vs. Computer**, but the computer is dumb and only makes random moves, so I would implement a Player vs. Player version _one day_
